# Advent of Code

My solution to several advent of code challenges (or at least the ones I end up solving before getting too busy).

The languages I used in different years:

| Year | Language   |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 2020 | C++        |
| 2021 | Rust       |
| 2022 | Python     |
| 2023 | Go         |
| 2024 | Javascript |
